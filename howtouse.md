# How to use the Sparked Paste service

1. First navigate to the main page @ https://paste.sparked.host

2. You will be greeted by a dark gray page where you can type text.

3. Paste code, text, log snippets, etc. on that page

4. Once you're done, you will see a save button on the top right corner of the page, click on that to save it, or use Control + S.

5. The URL on your browser will update, and syntax highlighting will be applied to your paste. Copy that new URL and send it wherever you want.
